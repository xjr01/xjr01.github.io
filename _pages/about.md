I am currently a Ph.D. student of the School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Peking University, advised by Prof. Baoquan Chen. In 2023, I graduated from Turing Class and obtained my bachelor's degree at School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University.

My research interests lie in physical simulation in computer graphics. I am particularly interested in simulating natural phenomena like fluids, solids, elastic bodies and their couplings. Up till now, I've worked on improving the fluid solver's efficiency and stability for surface tension effects. Recently, I focus on exploring new spatial representations for fluid simulations to promote new possibilities on combining with deep learning and generative models.
